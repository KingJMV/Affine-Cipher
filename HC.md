1. Affine cipher is a type of monoalphabetic substitution cipher
2. Each letter in an alphabet is mapped to its numeric equivalent, encrypted using a simple mathematical function, and converted back to a letter
3. Has the weaknesses of all substitution ciphers
4. 312 possible keys for the Affine Ciphe
5. Affine cipher is less secure than a substitution cipher as it is vulnerable to all of the attacks that work against substitution ciphers, in addition to other attacks
