#Fun Facts

1. Since we know a and m are relatively prime this can be used to rapidly discard many "false" keys in an automated system.
2. The affine cipher is a type of monoalphabetic substitution cipher, where each letter in an alphabet is mapped to its numeric equivalent, encrypted using a simple mathematical function, and converted back to a letter.
3. All natural numbers - numbers in the set can be expressed as the product of two or more numbers.
4. Each letter is enciphered with the function (ax + b) mod 26, where b is the magnitude of the shift.
5. There are 312 affine ciphers include, as special cases,the 26 Caesar ciphers, and the multiplicative ciphers.
