# Affine-Cipher

facts about affine cypher 

1:alphabet is mapped to its numeric equivalent, encrypted using a simple mathematical function, and converted back to a letter

2:A cipher uses a system of fixed rules -- an encryption algorithm -- to transform plaintext, a legible message, into ciphertext, an apparently random string of characters. Ciphers can be designed to encrypt or decrypt bits in a stream, known as stream ciphers.

3:A cipher algorithm is a mathematical formula designed specifically to obscure the value and content of data. 

4:encrypting first with a cipher from one group and then re-encrypting using a cipher that is not in that group.
